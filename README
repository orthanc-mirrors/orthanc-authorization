Advanced authorization for Orthanc
==================================


General Information
-------------------

This repository contains the source code of an advanced authorization
plugin for Orthanc.

For each incoming REST request to some URI, the plugin will query a
Web service to know whether the access is granted to the
user. Authorization credentials can be retrieved either from a GET
argument, or from a HTTP header.


Installation and usage
----------------------

Build instructions are similar to that of Orthanc:
https://book.orthanc-server.com/faq/compiling.html

Usage details are available as part of the Orthanc Book:
http://book.orthanc-server.com/plugins/authorization.html


API
---

Since version 0.5.0, the plugin implements a RestA API to generate tokens
(provided that the Web service is able to do so).

Sample Orthanc Flavored API:

curl -X PUT http://localhost:8042/auth/tokens/resource-instant-link -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"ID": "toto",
       "Resources" : [{
         "DicomUid": "1.2",
         "OrthancId": "",
         "Level": "study"
       }],
       "Type": "resource-instant-link", 
       "ExpirationDate": "2026-12-31T11:00:00Z"}'

Sample response:
  {
    "Token": "e148.....",
    "Url": null
  }

The API that must be implemented by the webservice is slighlty different wrt naming conventions:

curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/tokens/resource-instant-link -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"id": "toto",
       "resources" : [{
         "dicom-uid": "1.2",
         "level": "study"
       }],
       "type": "resource-instant-link", 
       "expiration-date": "2026-12-31T11:00:00Z"}'

Sample response:
  {
    "token": "e148.....",
    "url": null
  }
